**lightning-kmp** is a [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) implementation of the Lightning Network (see the [Lightning Network Specifications (BOLTs)](https://github.com/lightning/bolts)) optimized for mobile wallets. It can run on many platforms, including mobile devices (iOS and Android).

It is different from [eclair](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair) which is an implementation optimized for servers (routing nodes).
It shares a lot of architecture choices with eclair though, which comes from years of experience developing one of the main lightning implementations.
But it optimizes completely different scenarios, as wallets will not relay payments but rather send and receive them.
Read [this article](https://medium.com/@ACINQ/when-ios-cdf798d5f8ef) for more details.

**lightning-kmp** is used in [Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/), the best non-custodial Lightning Wallet!
